						<h3>What To Expect</h3>
						<p>
							Every class begins with a formal bow to the spirit and recognition of O Sensei as the founder of Aikido.
							The instructor is then recognized with a formal bow. The class is then led in warm up stretches that stimulate the muscles and joints.
							After warming up, the instructor demonstrates techniques that are practiced by the students in pairs. During training, breathing and body motions are combined within Aikido techniques in order to understand and practice the efficient use of the body.
							Injuries in Aikido are rare because constant attention is paid to the safety of all students; especially beginners.
							Each new student is individually trained in the techniques of falling and rolling properly. Beginning students receive special attention from the Chief Instructor and senior students to ensure correct practice and understanding of the basics.
							After several weeks, the beginning student is free to practice with all students who possess a variety of skill levels. Class closes by bowing to O Sensei, the instructor, and fellow students in thanks for instruction and mutual respect.
						</p>
						<h3>Aikido</h3>
						<p>
							Alameda Aikikai offers beginning through advanced classes in aikido. In aikido, men and women cooperate in daily practice aimed at making the mind and body become more harmonious with nature. Because of its great versatility, aikido may be practiced by both young and old as a martial art for self-defense as well as a method of physical and spiritual training.
							Since competition often raises negative emotional qualities that are contrary to the harmonious spirit of aikido, we offer regularly scheduled non-compulsory testing evaluations for students who desire to advance in rank. These testing sessions are based on a nationally recognized series of guidelines and requirements developed by <a href="https://birankai.org/">T.K. Chiba, Shihan</a>, and ensure the strong transmission O'Sensei's aikido throughout the United States. Candidates for testing must meet minimum required training hours.
							Training in aikido improves flexibility, muscle tone, endurance, and the stimulation and direction of ki (universal energy). Moreover, through disciplined and focused study, aikido students learn to become more centered in their lives, allowing a sense of calm to penetrate their actions and thoughts.
						</p>
						<h3>Weapons</h3>
						<p>
							<em>The sword and jyo are extensions of your body and must be handled as if they have your blood running through them," writes the late master Kisshomaru Ueshiba in his book, Aikido. Unless you can make the weapons part of your body, you have not truly trained in aikido.</em>
							<br /><br />Weapons study is used to augment aikido training. Weapons class primarily utilize the wooden sword (bokken), the staff (jo), knife (tanto) and short sword (wakazashi).
							Through the study of basic forms and partner practice we attempt to further understand the art of Aikido, particularly the study of timing and distance (maai).
						</p>
						<h3>Iaido</h3>
						<h4>History</h4>
						<p>
							Iaido (The Way of Sword Drawing) traces its origins to the late 16th century in Japan. It was developed by Hayashizaki Shigenobu. Though an established fact that some Iai-jutsu was practiced within other schools prior to Hayashizaki’s birth, he is credited with the creation of the system of Iai which we know today as Muso Shinden Ryu, which was actually developed based on a vision that Hayashizaki received in a dream, and which he referred to as Batto-Ho. The traditions and forms of Muso Shinden Ryu were transmitted through successive generations of swordsmen, among them Nakayama Hakudo Sensei, commonly recognized as one of the two foremost martial artists of the Meiji Era (O’Sensei being the other). One of Nakayama Sensei’s foremost students, Mitsuzuka Takeshi Sensei, established himself in Tokyo and continued the teachings of the Muso Shinden Ryu as transmitted to him by Nakayama Sensei.
						</p>
						<h4>Iai and Birankai</h4>
						<p>
							During his time as an Uchi-deshi, Chiba Sensei was directed to study Iaido by O’Sensei, who had several encounters with Iai masters and recognized their ability as martial artists. After returning to Japan from the United Kingdom in the late 1970s, Chiba Sensei continued his studies with Mitsuzuka Sensei, whom he recognized as one of the foremost Iai practitioners in Japan.
							The result of Chiba Sensei’s research is what we today practice as Iai Batto-ho (Sword-drawing method), which reflects his desire to combine the three major disciplines (aikido, Batto-Ho and Zen) in order to establish the martial root and culture within our practice. Swordsmanship played a significant role in the development of the warrior culture in Japan, and can play the same role in the development of future generations of Aikidoists.
							In 1985, Flynn Sensei traveled to Japan, where he studied Aikido at Hombu Dojo and Muso Shinden Ryu Iai-do with Mitsuzuka Takeshi Sensei, and received Iaido Shihan title from Mitsuzuka Sensei. Upon his return to the U.S. from Japan, he continued his practice under T.K. Chiba, Shihan.
							The techniques of Iai Batto-Ho are derived from two major schools within Japan. From Muso Shinden Ryu we utilize the 12 techniques of Shoden (Omori Ryu) and the 10 techniques of Chuden. From Shindo Munen Ryu we incorporate the 12 forms and use them as our Tachi Iai (Standing forms). The forms are listed below:

						<h4>Zazen</h4>
						<p>
							Zen has a strong link to the martial culture of Japan. Both the warrior culture and zen discipline emphasize the impermanence of life and teach us to be present in the moment, here and now.
							Ultimately, a warrior wages war against him/herself in an attempt to shed his/her numerous delusions, and to become unconditionally present. Zen is a non-intellectual practice; through sitting it is possible to see one's true nature.
							Zazen, or zen meditation, is practiced on Tuesday evenings and is open to all members. The essence of Zazen training is posture, breathing, and attitude of mind. During the meditation we simply sit still and practice mindfulness. Unlike other Zazen schools we do not attach any religious connotations or significance to our practice of Zazen. Often times chanting The Heart Sutra is conducted.
						</p>
						<h3>Children Program</h3>
						<p>
							Children as young as five years of age benefit from practicing Aikido. Children are avid learners of new material. They enjoy challenging their young minds and bodies and take special pride in mastering new skills. In addition, they require regular exercise to stay fit both physically and mentally. Keeping this in mind, we strive to attain the following goals with children:
							<ol>
								<li>Develop physical and mental awareness</li>
								<li>Improve flexibility and coordination</li>
								<li>Enrich interpersonal skills</li>
								<li>Enhance self-esteem and self-confidence</li>
								<li>Provide overall body conditioning</li>
							</ol>
							Instruction is initially centered around physical exercises designed to improve motor skills and increase physical coordination. The children are then taught how to fall without hurting themselves. After the students are comfortable with falling, we introduce basic martial arts principles of movement. In conjunction with these principles, we instruct them in the techniques of Aikido. Cooperation and teamwork are stressed as the more accomplished children assist the newer students in developing their skills.
