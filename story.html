						<h2>Story of Logo</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
						<span class="image featured"><img src="images/story_logo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<h3>Original</h3>
						<p>The original logo was created by my mother using my father Mike Flynn Shihan's vision.  The logo shows Alameda as it sits here on The Bay, and how on a clear day Mount Tam is visible from the dojo.</p>
						<h3>Transition</h3>
						<p>When the dojo’s chief instructor changed from Mike Flynn Shihan to Elmer Tancinco Sensei, the logo evolved.  As the new chief instructor, I wanted to continue the evolution of the logo to reflect my vision for our dojo’s philosophy and future practice. The desire is to continue the legacy of the original design while blending together both my personal Japanese heritage and the art of Aikido. The logo shows bamboo, wind-blown waves, and the rising sun with the mountain in the background, incorporating our new motto of Furinkazan. Surrounding the logo are the name of the dojo, our motto in kanji(furinkazan), and Saku Sen Kan(our given name by Chiba Sensei) in kanji as well.</p>
						<h3>Furinkazan</h3>
						<p>Furinkazan literally translates as Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain. The logo is going off the battle cry from The Art of War:  "As swift as wind, as gentle as forest, as fierce as fire, as unshakable as mountain."  I chose to use this as the motto because I believe furinkazan encompasses all of the essences of martial arts and especially Aikido.  In my eyes, I think that if you come from Alameda Aikikai, you must be able to encompass all of these factors.</p>
						<h3>Wind and Waves</h3>
						<p>I think you need to be able to move off the line as swift and smooth as blowing wind to allow you to not disrupt the energy/attack coming at you. You also need to be able to swiftly move with nage when they are throwing you as uke. Lastly, you must be like a wave crashing down able to take the shape of whatever you encounter and move fluidly.</p>
						<h3>Forest</h3>
						<p>I believe you need to practice gentleness in training and with all those around us. Aikido is a peaceful art and you should strive to have that compassion and gentleness when training with different partners, as well as with interpersonal conflict outside the dojo. Just like how a bamboo forest is able to bend to the stresses around it.</p>
						<h3>Fire</h3>
						<p>I believe you need to train as fierce as fire. When training with Mike Flynn Shihan and Chiba Shihan you could feel the intensity and passion they had by just being on the mat with them. This lit a fire inside of you and motivated you to practice and grow as a martial artist.  This is that same feeling that needs to be recreated and maintained inside of us.</p>
						<h3>Mountain</h3>
						<p>Lastly, you need to be able to be unshakable as a mountain. It speaks to the hara you must develop as martial artists where you must train your center and not be easily moved. This can also be put into practice by staying grounded and humble, by not letting our ego get the best of us.  All these factors come into play together in a single philosophy and it is my hope that all who enter our dojo will respect these ideals and train to develop all of these attributes.</p>
						<h3>Saku Sen Kan</h3>
						<p>This is our given name from T.K. Chiba Shihan, founder of Birankai, and Mike Flynn Shihan’s teacher.  After seeing the dojo grow over the years, Chiba Sensei gave this name to Alameda Aikikai with his translation being “Northern Elite School.”  We must continue to strive to live up to this name and continue with the rigorous practice that is our lineage.</p>
